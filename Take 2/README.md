I hope to make a project analyzing financial market volatility. In the financial sector, HPC is a very sought after skill, and one of main attributes of interest of a stock is its volatility. I would like to write a program that calculates a stock's volatility using various means of parallel programming. MPI and OpenMP will be used to measure volatility (and potentially other financial metrics).
